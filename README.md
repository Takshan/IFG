# IFG (Identify Functional Groups)

Python algorithms which extract functional group data from SMILES (Simplified molecular-input line-entry system) codes

# Usage

To generate the organic functional groups from a CHON molecule, the following packages are required:

```
    xlsxwriter
    pandas
    progress
```

To execute the program, run python version 3.5+ in an anaconda environemnt with the above packages on the index.py file.
An excel file of the generated smiles codes, according those given in the smiles.txt under resources, will be output and pre-cleaned, thanks
to pandas
