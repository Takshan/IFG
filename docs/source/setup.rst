How To Set Up IFG
=================

To set up IFG for functional group data collection and analysis from SMILES codes, follow the steps below:

1. Install `git <https://git-scm.com/downloads>`_
2. Install `poetry <https://python-poetry.org/docs/>`_
3. Clone the `github repository <https://github.com/wtriddle/IFG.git>`_ 

.. code-block::
    
    C:\> git clone https://github.com/wtriddle/IFG.git

4. Install the python packages required for IFG with poetry

.. code-block::
    
    C:\IFG> poetry install

You are now ready to use IFG!
