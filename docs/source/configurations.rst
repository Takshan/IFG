File-Path Configurations
========================

The ``config.py`` module lists configurable file paths for IFG used in the source files and script files.

SMILES Code Paths 
-----------------

File paths to sets of SMILES codes used during computation.

`STRUCTURES_PATH`
    The path to a file with a list of organic molecule SMILES codes to process in the ``main.py`` script

.. warning:: 
    The organic molecule SMILES codes must be hydrogen-suppressed

`FUNCTIONAL_GROUPS_PATH`
    The path to a file with the list of identifiable functional group SMILES codes

.. warning::
    The functional group SMILES codes must be correctly defined to be identifiable

Excel Sheet Paths
-----------------

File paths to output excel data sheets.

`MAIN_OUTPUT_PATH`
    The path to the excel file generated by the ``main.py`` script

`ANALYSIS_OUTPUT_PATH`
    The path to the excel file generated by the ``analysis.py`` script

`BANDGAPS_PATH`
    The path to the excel file with the bandgaps used by the ``analysis.py`` script

.. warning:: 
    The specific sheet which lists the desired bandgap values from the ``BANDGAPS_PATH`` excel file
    must be configured inside of the ``analysis.py`` file in the ``Data Load`` section of the script.


.. note:: 
    A ``resources`` and ``output`` folder are created by default and can be used according to their purposes of 
    storing resource files used by scripts and output files by the script.
